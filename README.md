# Olhando, Lendo e Interagindo (OLI): Educational Color Recognition Game

## üìö About the Project

This project presents the development of an interactive software for color recognition in the form of an educational game, designed to support **child development**. Grounded in the principles of ***Game Based Learning (GBL)*** and inspired by the theories of **Jean Piaget**, the system aims to stimulate learning through the child's **active interaction with the environment**, promoting cognitive growth and visuomotor coordination in a playful and inclusive way. The technology used is ***React Native***.

## üìç Purpose and Target Audience

To encourage children aged **2 to 10 years** to recognize colors and interact with real-world objects, reinforcing cognitive, motor, and language skills through visual challenges. Designed for children, educators, and parents interested in digital tools that support early childhood development.

## üéÆ How It Works

The game displays a **color on the screen** and asks the child to show an object of the same color to the camera:

- The color changes after a **correct identification**, earning the player a star;
- The game ends when the player collects **five stars**.

The system will offer **three levels of difficulty**:

- **Easy**: primary and secondary colors, without tonal variations;
- **Medium**: primary and secondary colors, with tonal variations;
- **Hard**: primary, secondary, and tertiary colors.

Additional game features:

- Players can set a **timer**: 4 minutes, 2 minutes, 1 minute, 45 seconds, or 30 seconds;
- A future update will include the option to play in **Portuguese or English**, encouraging early exposure to a second language.
# Welcome to your Expo app üëã

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
