# Olhando, Lendo e Interagindo (OLI): Educational Color Recognition Game

## üìö About the Project

This project presents the development of an interactive software for color recognition in the form of an educational game, designed to support **child development**. Grounded in the principles of ***Game Based Learning (GBL)*** and inspired by the theories of **Jean Piaget**, the system aims to stimulate learning through the child's **active interaction with the environment**, promoting cognitive growth and visuomotor coordination in a playful and inclusive way. The technology used is ***React Native***.

## üìç Purpose and Target Audience

To encourage children aged **2 to 10 years** to recognize colors and interact with real-world objects, reinforcing cognitive, motor, and language skills through visual challenges. Designed for children, educators, and parents interested in digital tools that support early childhood development.

## üéÆ How It Works

The game displays a **color on the screen** and asks the child to show an object of the same color to the camera:

- The color changes after a **correct identification**, earning the player a star;
- The game ends when the player collects **five stars**.

The system will offer **three levels of difficulty**:

- **Easy**: primary and secondary colors, without tonal variations;
- **Medium**: primary and secondary colors, with tonal variations;
- **Hard**: primary, secondary, and tertiary colors.

Additional game features:

- Players can set a **timer**: 4 minutes, 2 minutes, 1 minute, 45 seconds, or 30 seconds;
- A future update will include the option to play in **Portuguese or English**, encouraging early exposure to a second language.
